## About me

My name is Heric Camargo. I'm a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Paraná.

I was part of the UFPR Meteorology Laboratory as an undergrad research fellow. I currently work as a systems administrator at the [C3SL (Centro de Computação Científica e Software Livre)](https://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/).

I enjoy computing, automating things, and tweaking setups until they break—then fixing them again.

You can learn more about me on the [Contact]({{< relref "/contact" >}}) page.
